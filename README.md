## Work Experience
**Data Scientist Intern @ UnionBank of the Philippines (_April 2023 - September 2023_)**
- Contributed to the development of the Explainable and Responsible Artificial Intelligence (XRAI) guidelines and toolkit, providing data scientists with a better understanding of the models they build.
- Authored a new section on the XRAI guidelines about the feature selection techniques and some AI-related risks to look out for.
- Developed a comprehensive and easy-to-understand dashboard for the entire toolkit, providing an overview of the results obtained from evaluating the model on each available tool within the XRAI toolkit.
- Created a new feature for the toolkit by leveraging the AIF 360 fairness metrics and bias mitigation algorithms, including it to the wide-array of tools of XRAI.
- Deployed the toolkit for testing with other data science teams to evaluate its capabilities and gather feedback.

## Projects
**Multi-Stage Hybrid-CNN Transformer Model for Human Intent-Prediction (_August 2022 - July 2023_)** ([Repository](https://github.com/jbramos9/DSP03_AY2223))
- Led a team of 4 in designing and implementing a model that can predict human intention based on the objects they are gazing at using computer vision techniques.
- Developed a multi-stage model that includes a pre-trained monocular depth estimator, a Transformer intent classifier, and a CNN-transformer gazed object predictor using Python.
- Achieved an overall accuracy of 54%, precision of 46.19%, recall of 50.01%, and an F1 score of 45.53%, demonstrating the model's robust performance in predicting human intention.
- Accepted in 2023 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON) to present the paper for publishing.

**Projective Distortion Removal (_October 2022 - November 2022_)** ([Repository](https://github.com/jbramos9/removing_projective_distortion))
- Developed a python program that removes the inherent projective distortion on a rectangular object in an input image.
- Solved for the homography matrix given the four corner points of the rectangular object and performed linear transformation of the image using this matrix.
- Utilized OpenCV library for GUI design.

**EMG-Based System (_October 2022 - November 2022_)**
- Designed and implemented an open-loop EMG-based system consisting of an analog front-end unit, a transceiver unit, and a signal processing unit.
- Led a team of 3 in designing the analog front-end circuit and the transmitter side of the transceiver unit.
- Presented the design considerations and results to the project advisor.
- Utilized TINA for circuit design, MPLAB for the ADC of the transmitter using C programming language, and MATLAB for digital signal processing.
